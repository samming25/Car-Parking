The Car Parking Visualization project in CGV creates an immersive virtual environment that replicates a real-world car parking system. It provides real-time data on occupancy, available spaces, and vehicle movements. Users can interact with the system, analyze parking trends, and navigate through different areas. The project aims to enhance understanding, decision-making, and efficiency in managing and utilizing car parking spaces by offering an intuitive and visually appealing interface.
